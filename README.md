Own personal and very first website developed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4.0

I developed this website to put into practice what I learned about HTML and CSS.
To make it responsive, I used Bootstrap 4.0 that change the site layout acording to the screen where it's open. 
Also, I used BEM methodology to organise my CSS.
